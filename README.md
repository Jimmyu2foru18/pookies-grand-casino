# Pookie’s Grand Casino

Pookie’s Grand Casino is a browser-based casino-style game built using HTML and client-side assets. 
The project is inspired by GameHouse’s *Casino Island To Go* and is designed to deliver a classic casino look and feel through card graphics, table visuals, 
and a simple web interface.

This repository contains all front-end files and assets required to run the game directly in a modern web browser. 
No backend or server configuration is required.
